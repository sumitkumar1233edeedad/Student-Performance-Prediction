## 📌 Project Overview

The **Student Performance Prediction System** is an end-to-end Machine Learning project designed to predict students' academic performance based on demographic and academic factors.

This system helps educational institutions:

- Identify students at risk
- Analyze performance trends
- Provide early academic support
- Make data-driven decisions

The project includes **data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment using Streamlit**.
